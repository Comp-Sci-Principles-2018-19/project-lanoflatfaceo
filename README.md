## Big Fat Idea

Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator:
Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator is based of the very wacky game,
totally accurate battle simulator.http://landfall.se/totally-accurate-battle-simulator/ A game where you can have anything go up against anything.
Same principle in Totally Accurate Natural Disaster Simulator.
Would like to see an entire nation getting wiped out by a massive earthquake?
Sure. Want to see Japan get washed away by a massive Tsunami like a sand castle? No problem.
So, as you can see, you can put any natural disaster, even your own creations, and have them go up against anything.
People, buildings, vehicles, EVEN CHICKENS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 
# First Agile Iteration
I would be using functions in order to represent a type of natural disaster because this would allow the player to choose among many types of natural disasters.
This is also great for the coder (me) because this means i do not have to keep having to repeat stuff. Will have something along the lines of:
def Tsunami(w,s,rnd_num):
     """w=wave size, and s=strength of the tsuanmi"""
       if "w"<5:
             print(rnd_num_bwt_2000_and_5000+"people have died")
It will be text based.
