## Big Fat Idea

Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator:
Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator is based of the very wacky game,
totally accurate battle simulator.http://landfall.se/totally-accurate-battle-simulator/ A game where you can have anything go up against anything.
Same principle in Totally Accurate Natural Disaster Simulator.
Would like to see an entire nation getting wiped out by a massive earthquake?
Sure. Want to see Japan get washed away by a massive Tsunami like a sand castle? No problem.
So, as you can see, you can put any natural disaster, even your own creations, and have them go up against anything.
People, buildings, vehicles, EVEN CHICKENS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 
# First Agile Iteration
Creates a spreadsheet with the information coming from Wikipedia, this spreadsheet contains data from various earthquakes around the globe over the years. Right now, there are 10 earthquakes in this spreadsheet, each one containing their own set of how many deaths, wounded, damages (in US dollars), population density, as well as how strong the earhquakes were via the richter scale. Using a formula to then calculate the ratio (x):((RichterxPopulation)/Deaths=ratio). We will then take the average ratio from all 10 earthquakes, and use it in a function. THis function will take in the parameters of how strong the earthquake is in richter scale, as well as the population, and it return the amount of deaths. 



With this average, this is intened to be an estimate, and test with existing data, to see how close we are.
