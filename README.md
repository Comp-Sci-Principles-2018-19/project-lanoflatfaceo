## Big Fat Idea

Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator:
Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator is based of the very wacky game,
totally accurate battle simulator.http://landfall.se/totally-accurate-battle-simulator/ A game where you can have anything go up against anything.
Same principle in Totally Accurate Natural Disaster Simulator.
If you would like to see an entire nation getting wiped out by a massive earthquake?
Sure. Want to see Japan get washed away by a massive Tsunami like a sand castle? No problem.
So, as you can see, you can put any natural disaster, even your own creations, and have them go up against anything.
People, buildings, vehicles, EVEN CHICKENS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 
# First Agile Iteration
I would be using functions in order to represent a type of natural disaster because this would allow the player to choose among many types of natural disasters.
This is also great for the coder (me) because this means i do not have to keep having to stuff. Will have something along the lines of:
def Tsunami(w,s,rnd_num):
     """w=wave size, and s=strength of the tsuanmi"""
       if "w"<5:
             print(rnd_num_bwt_2000_and_5000+"people have died")
also would probably have to make it text based, hopefully not because it would be great to use something like unity (heard that unity's gravity settings are
not particularilry the best thought), or makybe unreal, or source. All three being great engines to get visual work done. Or even JavaScript
#What can you accomplish in about 4 weeks
 I can accomplish a lot of text based stuff, i.e. functions, conditionals, and turtles: We can do functions like the one i have mentioned above as an example.
And use conditionals to specifiy how many people have died for example. Now unfortunately, i have little to no experience with engines. Only thing
would be turtles, which could work, but are very limited for what i want to do.
