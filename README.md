## Big Fat Idea

Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator:
Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator is based of the very wacky game,
totally accurate battle simulator.http://landfall.se/totally-accurate-battle-simulator/ A game where you can have anything go up against anything.
Same principle in Totally Accurate Natural Disaster Simulator.
Would like to see an entire nation getting wiped out by a massive earthquake?
Sure. Want to see Japan get washed away by a massive Tsunami like a sand castle? No problem.
So, as you can see, you can put any natural disaster, even your own creations, and have them go up against anything.
People, buildings, vehicles, EVEN CHICKENS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 
# First Agile Iteration
```
def Tsunami(w,s,rnd_num):
     """w=wave size, and s=strength of the tsuanmi"""
       if "w"<5:
             print(rnd_num_bwt_2000_and_5000+"people have died")
```

It will be text based, and the example above will be done for each type of disaster. Each function will receive a set of conditionals with the tupple from the spreadsheet.
This is to ensure realistic results when asking the user for the population density, richter scale, etc. Would then set up an equation in the function, which does all of the processing, and then finally categorize which one of the conditions should it be in.
