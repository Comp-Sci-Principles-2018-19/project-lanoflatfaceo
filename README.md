# Project Name:

## Big Fat Idea
#Write your "Big Fat Idea" here. 
#Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator:
#Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator is based of the very wacky game,
#totally accurate battle simulator. A game where you can have anything go up against anything.
#Same principle in Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator.
#If you would like to see an entire nation getting wiped out by a massive earthquake?
#Sure. Want to see Japan get washed away by a massive Tsunami like a sand castle? No problem.
#So, as you can see, you can put any natural disaster, even your own creations, and have them go up against anything.
#People, buildings, vehicles, EVEN CHICKENS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 
## First Agile Iteration
#What can you accomplish in about 4 weeks?
# I would like to say that I can accomplish a fair amount of work done in 4 weeks, but it would depend. If it is all code based, yeah, I can get a lot of work done.
#If it has to do with graphicical stuff, i have not clue whatsoever. I guess it enhances the experience XD
