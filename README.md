## Big Fat Idea 
Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator:
Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator is based of the very wacky game,
totally accurate battle simulator. A game where you can have anything go up against anything.
Same principle in Totally accurate Natural disaster simulator.
If you would like to see an entire nation getting wiped out by a massive earthquake?
Sure. Want to see Japan get washed away by a massive Tsunami like a sand castle? No problem.
So, as you can see, you can put any natural disaster, even your own creations, and have them go up against anything.
People, buildings, vehicles, EVEN CHICKENS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 
## First Agile Iteration
Find a way to use square mileage, as well as population, and return population density.
Use population density to see how many people would die in a natural disaster. For 
Earthquakes, ask the user how strong the earthquake is, and ask for the population over the square mileage of which you are similating the disaster for, then it could tell you the amount of deaths and injuries. Use richter scale for it
Density, and deaths for now. 
sGet a table of richeter scale, popuation densty, and deaths for as many now earthquakes. start with 10 known earthquakes. Write the data as a list of tupples
